A site for working with some DnD-related things: displaying your characters or campaign/session management. Currently WIP and frontend-only.

## Current and planned pages

[all pages are currently frontend-only]

- Login/register
- Campaigns - list of your DnD games
- Story - page for a single DnD game, with quick info about it
- Characters - list of characters you made (since you can reuse them between games sometimes)

## Changes #1

- Made a color palette
- Improved css basically everywhere
- Fixed data loading on /campaigns
- Started working on the /story frontend page
